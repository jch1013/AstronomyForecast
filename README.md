# AstronomyForecast
The purpose of this project is to write a program that will allow for a user to send an email with a location to a 
specific email address and receive a response containing important information for astronomy, such as rise and set times
of the sun, moon, planets and other objects at that specific location. This program collects all necessary information 
into a single email, allowing the information to be easily printed and minimizing the need for electronic screens at 
night.

To use this service, simply send an email to <astroforecasttonight@gmail.com> with the desired location in the subject
line. This program will accept an address, a zipcode, the name of a city or coordinates as valid locations. A reply
email will be sent with important information for seeing conditions at night. A template email is shown below:

To: astroforecasttonight@gmail.com
From: <your_email>
Subject: Los Angeles
Body: (leave this blank)

<strong>** This project is not currently running. Work to constantly respond to emails is in progress **</strong>


NOTE: This program only works for locations within the United States, and data provided for international locations
may be either incorrect or missing.
