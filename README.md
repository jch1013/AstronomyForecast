# AstronomyForecast
The purpose of this project is to write a program that will allow for a user to send an email with a location to a 
specific email address and receive a response containing important information for astronomy, such as rise and set times
of the sun, moon, planets and other objects at that specific location. This program collects all necessary information 
into a single email, allowing the information to be easily printed and minimizing the need for electronic screens at 
night.
